# IPL-DashBoard
An IPL data dashboard can be a great way to see trends and insights from the cricket tournament. Here are some things your dashboard might include, based on your example of runs scored by batsman: 1)Team Performance. 2)Player Performance. 3)Season Comparisons.
1. Team Performance:

Runs Scored/Match: Show a stacked bar chart or line chart to compare the average runs scored by each team across seasons or the entire IPL history.
Winning Percentage: Include a win/loss percentage chart for each team to see which teams perform better under pressure. This can be further segmented by factors like batting first vs chasing.
Top Run Scorers by Team: Include a table or chart highlighting the players with the most runs scored for each team throughout the IPL.
2. Player Performance:

Batting Average: A bar chart showing the average runs scored per dismissal for batsmen across seasons or their IPL career.
Strike Rate: Another bar chart to compare the strike rates (runs scored per 100 balls) of different batsmen.
Most Runs Scored/Season: Identify the player with the most runs scored in each IPL season.
3. Season Comparisons:

Overall Runs Scored: A line chart showing the total runs scored across all IPL seasons. This can be helpful to see if the overall scoring rate is increasing or decreasing.
Team Performance Over Time: Use a small multiples chart to compare the performance of each team across different seasons. This can reveal if a team is consistently strong or has had fluctuations.
Most Successful Chases: Include a table or chart highlighting the highest run chases achieved in each IPL season.
Collaboration Features:

Allow users to filter data based on specific teams, players, seasons, or even grounds.
Enable users to compare statistics side-by-side. For example, compare the batting averages of two batsmen across seasons.
Make the dashboard shareable so cricket fans can analyze and discuss the data together.
